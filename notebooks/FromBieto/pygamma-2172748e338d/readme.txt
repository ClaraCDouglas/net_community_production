First, if you have not already done so, consult the docstring
in __init__.py, and in particular, look at src/README and
src/ConditionsOfUse.  The latter is the relevant license
information for the original code.  All modifications and

The original procedure for developing the python wrapper is described
in the following:

Steps toward building the python interface to the gamma-n fortran
code.  We are starting in what will be the working directory, and
we have uncompressed gamma.tar.Z in its parent directory.  It is
obtained from

    ftp://ftp.marine.csiro.au/pub/jackett/gamma.tar.Z

mv gamma src
mkdir data
mv src/*.nc data

# Initialize the mercurial repository.
hg init

# add  .hgignore file

hg add
hg commit

# From this point on, changes are recorded as hg commits.

The initial changes to the fortran code are minimal: remove the
need for a preprocessing stage by making the gamma.nc file path
a function argument instead of a compiled-in constant determined
at compile time.

The _gamma.pyf file was initially generated by changing the extensions
to *.f90 to get around the non-f77-standard long lines, and then running:

f2py -h gamma-n.pyf --overwrite-signature\
          atg.f90 \
          depth-ns.f90 \
          depth-scv.f90 \
          derthe.f90 \
          eosall.f90 \
          eos8d.f90 \
          e-solve.f90 \
          gamma-errors.f90 \
          gamma-n.f90 \
          goor.f90 \
          gamma-qdr.f90 \
          get-lunit.f90 \
          goor-solve.f90 \
          index.f90 \
          neutral-surfaces.f90 \
          ocean-test.f90 \
          scv-solve.f90 \
          sig-vals.f90 \
          stp-interp.f90 \
          svan.f90 \
          theta.f90 \
          read-nc.F90 \
        only: gamma_n neutral_surfaces

This preliminary version was then edited to add module and
interface directives.
